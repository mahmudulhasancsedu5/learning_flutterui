# learning_flutterui

A new Flutter project.

## Flutter Concepts
- [Building user interfaces with Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui)
### Widget
- The core of Flutter's layout mechanism is widgets. In Flutter, almost everything is a widgetâ€”even layout models are widgets. The images, icons, and text that you see in a Flutter app are all widgets. But things you don't see are also widgets, such as the rows, columns, and grids that arrange, constrain, and align the visible widgets.
- You create a layout by composing widgets to build more complex widgets
- Widgets are temporary objects, used to construct a presentation of the application in its current state.
  
### StatelessWidget

### StatefulWidget

### State
- State objects on the other hand are persistent between the calls to build(), allowing them to remember information.
